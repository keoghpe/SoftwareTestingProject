#Software Testing Project - Stub's Gunbook

The purposed of this project was to develop a program according to the specification outlined below. The program was then to be tested using a testing tool of our choice. We had the freedom to choose any programming language we liked so we decided to experiment with the MEAN stack architecture. When presenting our program we also presented our testing tool, Karma. The presentation is included in this repository.

##Program Specification

A rifle salesperson in the former Arizona Territory sold rifle locks, stocks, and barrels made by a gunsmith in Missouri. Locks cost $45, stocks cost $30, and barrels cost $25. The salesperson had to sell at least one complete rifle per month, and production limits were such that the most the salesperson could sell in a month was 70 locks, 80 stocks, and 90 barrels. After each town visit, the salesperson sent a telegram to the Missouri gunsmith with the number of locks, stocks, and barrels sold in that town. At the end of a month, the salesperson sent a very short telegram showing -1 locks sold. 
The gunsmith then knew the sales for the month were complete and computed the salesperson’s commission as follows: 10% on sales up to (and including) $1000, 15% on the next $800, and 20% on any sales in excess of $1800. 
The commission program produced a monthly sales report that gave the total number of locks, stocks, and barrels sold, the salesperson’s total dollar sales, and, finally, the commission.
